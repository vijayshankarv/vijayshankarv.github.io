title: About me

---

I am a physicist turned data scientist interested in a whole gamut of things. Currently, I am most passionate about melding machine learning and design to build applications to aid complex problem-solving.  

At present, I am a Senior Data Scientist at [PagerDuty][PD]. Prior to that, I was at [Capital One Canada][Capital One], where I worked on analytical strategies to tackle credit card fraud.

At my core, I am deeply curious about understanding how systems work and then using that understanding to further shape system behaviour. It was this curiosity that led me to pursue Physics, where I delved into understanding interacting many-particle systems as part of my Ph.D. Now I bring that scientific temperament and the aptitude to pick up varied technical machinery to bear on problems in technology.

**Science and Technology Education**: Outside of work, I am passionate about science and technology education. While the pandemic has dampened my volunteering, I thoroughly enjoyed contributing to the missions of [SteamLabs][steamlabs], [Action Potential Lab][apl], [Math Circles][math-circ],[First Robotics][first-rob], and [Ladies Learning Code][llc].

**Hobbies**: If it is ‚òÉÔ∏è, you can find me practising my mandolin or reading a üìñ.  If it is üåû, I am usually on my üö≤
